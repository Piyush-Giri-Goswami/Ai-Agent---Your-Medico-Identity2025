YOUR MEDICO – AI Medical Appointment & Reminder Bot
YOUR MEDICO is an AI‑powered assistant that lives on Telegram and helps users schedule doctor appointments and manage prescription reminders using natural language. It connects Telegram, Google Gemini, Google Calendar, and Gmail using an n8n AI Agent workflow.​​

How the bot works (user flow)
The user chats with a Telegram bot (for example, “Book an appointment with Dr. Munesh tomorrow at 10 AM for stitches removal” or “Set a reminder for my antibiotics for 5 days”). Telegram sends the message to n8n via the Telegram Trigger, where the workflow extracts the chat_id as sessionId and the message text. A Medical Assistant AI Agent (Google Gemini Chat Model) reads the message, understands the intent, and decides whether to schedule an appointment, create a reminder, send an email confirmation, or just answer questions about medicines and follow‑ups.​

For scheduling, the agent calls a Google Calendar tool to create a calendar event with the doctor name, date, time, and visit reason, using the clinic’s Google account. If email notifications are enabled, the agent also calls Gmail to send an appointment confirmation mail to the user’s address. Finally, the agent returns a friendly, formatted response (for example, confirmation with date/time and optional Meet link), and n8n sends it back to the same Telegram chat_id using the Telegram “Send message” node.​​

How the bot is built (technical overview)
The orchestration layer is an n8n cloud workflow that uses an AI Agent node connected to tool nodes for Calendar and Gmail. The conversation entry point is a Telegram Bot created via BotFather and integrated with n8n using the Telegram Trigger node and the bot token; each update JSON contains message.chat.id (user) and message.text (input). A small “Prepare Session Data” node then maps sessionId = {{ $json["message"]["chat"]["id"] }} and message = {{ $json["message"]["text"] }} so every subsequent node can rely on a consistent schema instead of raw Telegram JSON.​

The “brain” of the workflow is the Google Gemini Chat Model attached to the Medical Assistant Agent node. The system prompt defines the role (medical assistant at YOUR MEDICO), available capabilities (book or modify appointments, set reminders, provide educational medication information), and safety rules, and tells the agent when to call tools instead of replying only with text. When the agent decides to schedule or update an appointment, it invokes the Google Calendar Tool (an n8n Google Calendar node with OAuth2 credentials) configured to create events in a specific calendar. When the user requests an email confirmation, the agent calls a Gmail node (also authenticated via OAuth2) to send a structured email containing the appointment information to the user’s email address. The final AI reply—whether it is a confirmation, reminder details, or clarification question—is passed to a Telegram “Send message” node, which targets chat_id = {{ $node["Telegram Trigger"].json["message"]["chat"]["id"] }} so every answer goes back to the correct Telegram user chat.​​
